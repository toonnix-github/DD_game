I love the board game "Tiny Epic Dungeon." I played with my son, and we loved it, so I want to have this in a digital version.

MVP
- dungeon with 7x7 tiles
- 60 prepared room tiles
- Open new rooms when a character moves to the room, open only the tiles that connect to the exits from the current tile.
- 2 characters, knight and archer.
- A character can only move
- Character has basic attributes
- move - that tells how many steps they can move
- hp
- activity points
- attack power
- defence power
