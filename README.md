# DD_game

This project aims to build a digital adaptation of the board game **Tiny Epic Dungeon** using JavaScript and React.

The current version shows a hero portrait drawn in a Hearthstoneâ€‘style. Each hero now has unique artwork making it clear which character is a knight or an elf.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (this also installs frontend packages):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   You can verify the setup by running the linter:
   ```bash
   npm run lint --prefix frontend
   ```
2. Build the React app:
   ```bash
   npm run build --prefix frontend
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## MVP Features
- Dungeon with a 7x7 grid of tiles.
- 70 prepared room tiles.
- Open new rooms only when a character moves to a connecting exit.
- Two characters: knight and elf.
- Choose your hero at the start of the game.
- Characters have attributes:
  - Movement range
  - HP
  - Activity points
  - Attack power
- Defence power

The hero panel now displays these attributes along with a portrait image for the selected hero.

### Customizing Hero Stats

Starting values for each hero type can be modified in
`frontend/src/heroData.js`. Edit the stats there to tweak the characters
without touching the game logic.

### Artwork Credits

The colored knight and elf portraits shown in the game are custom SVG assets
created for this project. They replace the monochrome icons previously sourced
from the [Game Icons](https://game-icons.net/) project.
